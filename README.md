My personal Blockchain project. This project initialize a medical record 
system that leverages blockchain technology to securely store, manage, 
and share patient health data. It ensures data integrity, privacy, 
and accessibility by allowing authorized users, such as healthcare providers and patients, to access and update records through a decentralized network.
